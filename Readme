Hi !

This is a coursera guided  project by Ikechukwu Ogbuchi on BigQuery which actually works on BigData and performs visualizations.
Here you'll find all the insights about the course and all my learning. 


Important Information:

(1)  BigQuery is a Google Cloud service.
(2) The data used in this project is CoVID-19 Data in CSV file format. It contains 100,000 rows of COVID cases.
(3) The data set is taken from the website humdata.org
